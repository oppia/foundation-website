      Oppiaâ€™s lesson creation team is responsible for creating a set of highly
      effective and enjoyable lessons that students around the world can use for
      free. The team follows a tested process to generate effective lessons that
      appeal to students from all backgrounds.

      Our goal is to not only teach
      students in an easily digestible way, but also encourage a positive
      attitude towards learning. Currently, we're focusing on basic mathematics,
      but intend to expand to other subjects in the future.
