## Purpose

The Oppia Foundation website, located at OppiaFoundation.org, exists to communicate Oppia's mission, story and impact. An individual who knows little to nothing about Oppia should come away from a visit to this website with a solid understanding of the problem Oppia aims to solve, how it aims to solve it, and why solving it is so important. In contributing to the Foundation site, please keep this purpose in mind at all times.
