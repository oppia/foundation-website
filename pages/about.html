  <h2>About Oppia</h2>

  <p>
    One of Oppia's strengths is its ability to bring interactivity and
    <a href="https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/resources/learning/learning-activities/guided-discovery-problems">
      guided discovery learning
    </a>
    to online, computer-based learning. Thus, a common format for an Oppia exploration is to pose a problem to the reader, and guide them towards
    solving this problem by posing a series of questions. This way, the reader
    actively discovers the answer with the exploration's help, as opposed to
    just being told what the answer is.
