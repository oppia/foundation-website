      <h3>A new approach to online learning </h3>
      <p>
        Oppia is a free and open-source online learning platform for collaboratively creating and sharing interactive lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oppia’s lesson builder allows educators to provide students with targeted, personalized   feedback that simulates conversation with an intelligent, virtual tutor.

      <h3>Impacting students around the world</h3>
      <p>
        Oppia was built to meet the unique needs of the developing world, where educational resources are scarce and methodologies are outdated. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Our storytelling-based approach to learning requires less bandwidth than educational videos, making it accessible in areas with limited internet connections. Adaptive lessons with personalized feedback create a safe, interactive learning environment otherwise unavailable to underserved communities.
      </p> 
      <p>
        By uniting a global community of volunteers and educators, Oppia’s lessons are continually translated into new languages and adapted for different cultures.
