        <p class="about-page-body-description-text-box">
          Lack of access to quality education has been identified by the United Nations as one of the world's most pressing problems. At least 250 millions children worldwide have not achieved basic literacy and numeracy. To make matters worse, there is a 100 years gap between educational outcomes in developed and developing countries.
        </p>
        <p class="about-page-body-description-text-box">
          Why is this the case? Unfortunately, access to quality education is limited by factors like geography and wealth. Many regions lack resources to adequately support individual students.
        </p>
        <p class="about-page-body-description-text-box">
          Educational practices throughout most of the world are decades behind what research says is required for effective learning experiences. Textbooks and video lectures, for example, can deliver information, but they cannot cultivate understanding or provide students with the necessary practice and feedback to master a skill. This results in learning experiences that are neither effective nor enjoyable, causing students to struggle in the classroom and throughout life. Some even grow to dislike the idea of educational development altogether.

          The operating vision of The Oppia Foundation is to help anyone, anywhere learn anything they want in an effective and enjoyable way. Our current focus is on improving access to high-quality, affordable education for students who cannot attend school on a regular basis or whose school doesn’t provide them with a satisfactory learning experience.
        </p>
        <p class="about-page-body-description-text-box">
          The Oppia community works to develop and widely distribute effective, enjoyable online lessons in key subjects that reach millions of people who otherwise lack the necessary resources to learn the material. We want every individual, no matter what their personal circumstances, to have access to learning experiences that are not only pedagogically effective, but also fun and empowering.
        </p>
        <p class="about-page-body-description-text-box">
          Oppia’s unique technology simulates an interactive tutor, adapting each lesson to an individual learner’s needs with specific feedback and hints to help them improve. The platform is designed to allow lessons to be supplemented with subtitles in students’ native languages. Lessons are openly licensed and the platform is entirely open-source, enabling a diverse group of collaborators from around the world to make regular iterative improvements.

            Our Impact

        <p class="about-page-body-description-text-box">
          To date, over 800,000 users from all around the world have used Oppia to learn critical academic skills using more than 18,000 lessons created by our community of content creators. In early 2018, we conducted a randomized controlled trial of our first set of curated lessons (Fractions) in a low-income school in Delhi, India. The study showed that these students found lessons engaging and showed a significant improvement in concept mastery and compared to controls. An incredible 100% of students involved in the study said that they would recommend the lessons to their peers.
        </p>
        <p class="about-page-body-description-text-box">
          Additionally, we have been conducting user studies and pilots with students from around the world, including Cameroon, Zimbabwe, India and the United States. Feedback from these students has illustrated the powerful impact of the Oppia platform and serves as a guide for our efforts to improve the platform.
