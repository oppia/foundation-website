	<h5>More than 250 million children worldwide have not achieved basic literacy and numeracy.</h5>
	<h5>The Oppia Foundation is working to change that.</h5>

	<h3>A new approach to online learning </h3>
	<p>
	Oppia is a free and open-source online learning platform for collaboratively creating and sharing interactive lessons. Oppia’s lesson builder allows educators to provide students with targeted, personalized feedback that simulates conversation with an intelligent, virtual tutor.
	</p>

	<h3>Impacting students around the world</h3>
	<p>
	Oppia was built to meet the unique needs of the developing world, where educational resources are scarce and methodologies are outdated. Our storytelling-based approach to learning requires less bandwidth than educational videos, making it accessible in areas with limited internet connections. Adaptive lessons with personalized feedback create a safe, interactive learning environment otherwise unavailable to underserved communities. By uniting a global community of volunteers and educators, Oppia’s lessons are continually translated into new languages and adapted for different cultures.

	<h5>
	Since launching Oppia.org in 2015, over 800,000 learners in more than 20 countries have used our platform to explore, grow, and learn.
	</h5>

	<h3>Get involved</h3>
	<p>
	The Oppia Foundation is a community of open-source developers, researchers, and educators around the world who volunteer to make our vision a reality. We are always looking for new volunteers to help us make effective education available for everyone. 
	</p>

	<h3>Partner with us</h3>
	<p>
	We are looking for organizations that want to join us on our journey to transform how students learn online. With your help, we aim to improve our platform by conducting randomly controlled trials, fund a dedicated team of lesson creators, and manage the costs of scaling the Oppia project to serve learners across the world.
